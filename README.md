Multiply By Two
===============

**Warning, this module has malicious behaviour. Read first.**

This is a demonstration module used in my [blog post] on malicious node modules.
If you import this module, it will return a function which multiplies a number
by two. Additionally, it will attempt to hijack express in a manner that adds
a malicious payload to every request which intercepts stripe's client side 
library. See the blog post for more details.

This code is explicitly designed to not be very copy-and-paste portable, and 
will likely fail when imported into a project that doesn't behave exactly the
same as the [companion repository] for this project.

Although the payload is harmless and will only trigger an alert statement, 
please do not install this module unless you have evaluated it first and 
understand its behaviour. This exists on npm solely for research purposes as 
part of the companion repository, not for malicious usage.
